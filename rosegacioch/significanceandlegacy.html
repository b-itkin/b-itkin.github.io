				<p class="articletext">Rose Gacioch was emblematic of her times, and the times that were yet to come. As the daughter of immigrants, she exemplified a perfect representation of the American Dream. While everything was stacked against her in terms of gender and economic status after being orphaned, she sought out what she wanted to do in life: play baseball.</p>

    		<p class="articletext">Along the way, Gacioch lived and worked in 2 large industrial sections of the nation: the panhandle of West Virginia and the rust-belt of Rockford, Illinois after she retired. These parts of the nation were some of the hardest hit during the Great Depression, however she managed to hold onto jobs and barnstorm when there weren’t any.</p>


    		<p class="articletext">In addition, she worked and stayed single in a time when women were largely seen as having their place not as breadwinners, but as homemakers. Gacioch defied the gender roles of her time in-between the end of a suffrage-centered first-wave of feminism and a socially based second-wave of feminism in the 1960s. In fact, Gacioch took part in the seeds of second-wave feminism -- when women were taking over traditionally jobs like the manufacturing work that she undertook in the late twenties and thirties, she participated in one of the most symbolic examples of this by taking the traditionally male job of professional ball-player.</p>

    		<p class="articletext">Gacioch’s impressive statistics speak for themselves. As a four-time All-Star player in the AAGPBL, she made her impact on the league. The league itself would disband in 1954, however Gacioch would continue working in Rockford, Illinois at the Amerock corporation and retire in the Detroit area. In between her retirement and her death, she and her fellow players were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, and a character based on her would be played by Rosie O’Donnell in “A League of their Own”.</p>


    		<p class="articletext">Gacioch made such an impact on her community in Wheeling that she was honored posthumously in the Wheeling , West Virginia, Sports Hall of Fame. In addition, when she and friends needed money to go to an AAGPBL tribute at a Detroit Tigers game in 1998, a local paper ran a story and they very quickly got the necessary funds. The latter especially denotes the impact that the AAGPBL had on the rust-belt, as that was where the AAGPBL primarily played due to their funding by Wrigley.  To me personally, she serves as an inspiration that even if the odds are stacked against you, in America if you try hard enough you can have fun doing what you want in life.</p>
