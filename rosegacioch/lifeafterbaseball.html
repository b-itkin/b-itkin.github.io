	<h1 style="text-align: center;"> A Profile of Rose Gacioch:<br><br>Time Out; Life After Baseball. </h1>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid" id="main-text">
<p class="articletext"> After the All-American-Girls-Professional-Baseball-League disbanded, Rose Gacioch led a relatively quiet life. While AAGPBL players were like Gacioch were largely ignored for their athletic accomplishments until the nineties, Gacioch found profound success and notoriety in bowling. Arguably, Gacioch’s life after the AAGPBL’s existence was just as interesting and indicative of the times that she lived in.</p>

<p class="articletext">Gacioch stayed in Rockford, Illinois, after her baseball career and got a job as a press operator with the Amerock Corporation. She would work there up until her retirement in 1978 and eventually moved to Sterling Heights, Michigan to be closer to relatives. She also never married before her death. In this sense, Gacioch reflected the changing workforce both before and after World War II, as more and more women took on jobs that were traditionally held by men. It is also remarkable that she was a woman of her times in the sense that she never married, something that might be considered taboo if she had been born a half-century earlier. Gacioch's life was a foreshadowing of the women's rights movement in the 1960s, when women were asking for more chances to perform in non-traditionally female roles in society, and to be treated as equally as their male cunterparts. In all senses of the phrase, she was a self-made woman. Even her nieces who memorialized her thought she was special in this sense, one saying at the time of her death that: “I always looked forward to her coming to visit as a kid, because she was so different from us… she traveled. She taught me how to whistle, how to play ball, how to pitch.”</p>

<p class="articletext">In 1954, at the end of her career in baseball, Gacioch also showed a lot of promise as a professional bowler. Gacioch was on the International Bowling Congress’s champion doubles’ bowling team. While also playing golf for fun, Gacioch didn’t venture much further out into athletics -- womens’ athletics just weren’t taken as seriously as men’s, and sports’ commercialization of the latter was comparatively nascent to what it is today.</p>

<p class="articletext">The last decade or so of Gacioch’s life was profound in that her accomplishments in baseball were recognized for the first time since the 40s and 50s. Renewed interest from Americans in the AAGPBL was found when “A League of Their Own” hit the silver screen. In fact, the character played by Rosie O’Donnell was largely based on Rose Gacioch. Eventually, Gacioch along with many other AAGPBL players were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Gacioch remarked at the time that “Now I got something on Pete Rose. I got there before he did.”</p>

<p class="articletext">Rose Gacioch died peacefully in a nursing home in Clinton Township, Michigan, of heart failure on September 9th, 2004. While her baseball-career was remarkable on its own, it wasn’t the only thing that made Gacioch an interesting baseball-player to study for this profile. Her ability to live independently in a time of changing opportunities for women and her life before and after her career were also equally enlightening and interesting.</p>
