<p class="articletext">Rose Gacioch was born in the industrial town of Wheeling, West Virginia on August 31, 1915. Born to Polish parents, she was always attracted to Baseball at a young age. In fact, in grade school Gacioch managed to skip school and catch a game featuring Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth. At the age of 15, Rose was orphaned and dropped out of school. However, this didn’t prevent her from becoming the only girl on her town ball team, the “Little Cardinals”, a year later.</p> 

<p class="articletext">After her mother died and Gacioch became orphaned, she lied about her age and became employed at the local corrugating plant. Through a connection at the plant to the “Bloomer Girls’” western women’s baseball organizer and scout Maud Nelson, Gacioch was hired to play for the last season that “Bloomer Girls” Baseball teams were active.</p> 

<p class="articletext">Except for the knowledge that Gacioch would barnstorm in softball teams (a sport that was much a product of its times as Gacioch was, given that its origin is from the game of indoor baseball that was played in youth centers like the Hull-House) on and off up until her employment with the AAGPBL, we don’t know too much else about her early life. However, given the times and socioeconomic circumstances that she lived in, we can paint a better picture as to what her life might have been like in her early years.</p>

<p class="articletext">The most apparent was the sexism and social criticism that the “Bloomer Girls” had faced during their years that were active. According to Lois Browne in her book Girls of Summer: In Their Own League, the “Bloomer Girls” often faced criticism for not being feminine enough due to their playing what was widely seen as a man’s activity. Sexism was something that both the AAGPBL players and the Bloomer Girls struggled with over their active years. This isn’t surprising, as the 19th amendment was only passed in 1920, just 5 years after Gacioch was born. While there was enough societal support for women’s suffrage, gender roles were still very rigid at that point in time; the societal backlash to the trend of flappers in the 1920s would be prime evidence of this.</p>

<p class="articletext">Gacioch also was the daughter of Polish immigrants. The early 20th century was a time of mass immigration into the United States due to its relative religious freedom to other countries and better economic prospects than many other European countries at the time. When Gacioch’s parents died, we do know that she struggled economically to the point that she had to lie about her age in order to gain employment at a corrugation factory, so in all likelihood they had immigrated here under the same reasons that many others had for a better life economically. Gacioch’s struggles during the 1930’s in being employed while underage was also very common at the time due to the Great Depression, in the sense that if one was lucky enough to work, no matter their familial status or age, they worked.</p>

<p class="articletext">Gacioch’s early life is an example of how American women in the 1920s and 30s faced struggles in filling gender roles that were not traditionally female for both self-fulfillment and employment, but that it was very possible during that time period.</p>
